Welcome to our project!

We are Frozen and Wendy, the members of **Taoist Labs**. 

To know more about our different projects, you can find our github [TeamTaoist](https://github.com/TeamTaoist/) and [Taoist-Labs](https://github.com/Taoist-Labs).

Here we started the project REI Wallet since April 2024 just for fun. REI Wallet is a Chrome extension wallet for Nervos CKB. Also it supports the RGB++ protocol when we design it.
